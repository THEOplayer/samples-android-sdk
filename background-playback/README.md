# Reference Apps - Supporting background playback

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate how to use [THEOplayer] to:

- play-out media assets in a background service;
- use the [Media Session Connector] to report the playback state and receive player requests.

For quick start, please proceed with the [Quick Start](#quick-start) guide.
More information on how to use the [Media Session Connector] can be found on its documentation page and
the Android developer pages describing [Building a video app] and [Building an audio app].

## THEO Docs

This app is an extension of [THEO Basic Playback] application. For help with getting started with
THEOplayer or Android Studio feel free to check [THEOplayer documentation]


## Quick Start

1. Optionally obtain a THEOplayer license. By default the THEOplayer SDK only plays assets hosted on
   the `theoplayer.com` domain. For play-out of other streams first obtain a license at the
   [THEOplayer portal](https://portal.theoplayer.com/).

2. Open _**Background-Playback**_ application in Android Studio.

   Android Studio should automatically synchronize and rebuild project. If this won't happen please
   select **File > Sync Project with Gradle Files** menu item to do it manually. Please note, that
   in very rare cases it will be required to synchronize project twice.

3. Specify the obtained THEOplayer license in the [AndroidManifest.xml](./app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml),
   if applicable.

```xml
    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="THEOPLAYER_LICENSE"
            android:value="@string/theoplayer_license" />
    </application>
```

4. Select **Run > Run 'app'** menu item to run application on a device selected by default.

   To change the device please select **Run > Select Device...** menu item.
