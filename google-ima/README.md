## Quick Start

### Using library downloaded from [THEO Portal]

To use THEOplayer from a library downloaded from THEO Portal, follow these steps:

1. Obtain THEOplayer Android SDK with **Ads** feature enabled and unzip it.

   Please visit [Get Started with THEOplayer] to get required THEOplayer Android SDK.

2. Copy **`theoplayer-android-[name]-[version]-minapi21-release.aar`** file from unzipped SDK into
   application **[libs]** folder and rename it to **`theoplayer.aar`**.

   Project is configured to load SDK with such name, for using other name please change
   `implementation ':theoplayer@aar'` dependency in [app-level build.gradle] file accordingly.
   
3. Confirm that `app/build.gradle` has the Google IMA Android SDK as one of its dependencies.

4. Open _**THEO Google IMA**_ application in Android Studio.

   Android Studio should automatically synchronize and rebuild project. If this won't happen please
   select **File > Sync Project with Gradle Files** menu item to do it manually. Please note, that
   in very rare cases it will be required to synchronize project twice.

5. Select **Run > Run 'app'** menu item to run application on a device selected by default.
