# Reference Apps - THEO PiP Handling

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate how [THEOplayer] can be configured to allow
the Picture-in-Picture mode.

For quick start, please proceed with the [Quick Start](#quick-start) guide.


## THEO Docs

This app is an extension of [THEO Basic Playback] application. For help with getting started with
THEOplayer or Android Studio feel free to check [THEOplayer documentation]


## Quick Start

### Using THEOplayer distribution from public repository

This project is already set up to use THEOplayer from jitpack.io so you need to check it out and build.
Below is a short explanation about how to include THEOplayer in the project.
For the more comprehensive explanation please refer to [THEOplayer documentation].

To use THEOplayer from jitpack.io, you need to include it in the build.gradle file on the project level:

      allprojects {
          repositories {
              ...
              maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
              ...
          }
      }

Then, to use the library, specify the following in the module's level build.gradle file:

      dependencies {
          ...
          // THEOplayer required dependencies.
           implementation 'com.theoplayer.theoplayer-sdk-android:basic-minapi21:4.12.0'
          ...
      }

### Using library downloaded from [THEO Portal]

To use THEOplayer from a library downloaded from THEO Portal, follow these steps:
1. Obtain THEOplayer Android SDK and unzip it.

   Please visit [THEOplayer documentation] to get required THEOplayer Android SDK.

2. Copy **`theoplayer-android-[name]-[version]-minapi21-release.aar`** file from unzipped SDK into
   application **[libs]** folder and rename it to **`theoplayer.aar`**.

   Project is configured to load SDK with such name, for using other name please change
   `implementation ':theoplayer@aar'` dependency in [app-level build.gradle] file accordingly.

3. Open _**THEO PiP Handling**_ application in Android Studio.

   Android Studio should automatically synchronize and rebuild project. If this won't happen please
   select **File > Sync Project with Gradle Files** menu item to do it manually. Please note, that
   in very rare cases it will be required to synchronize project twice.

4. Select **Run > Run 'app'** menu item to run application on a device selected by default.
