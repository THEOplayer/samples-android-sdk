# Reference Apps - Using the MediaSession connector

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate how to use [THEOplayer] with the 
[Media Session Connector].

The Media Session Connector provides a universal way for Android to interact with THEOplayer.
Integrating with the connector allows an app to advertise media playback and to
receive playback commands from external sources, such as from a TV remote or through
Google Assistant commands using voice commands such as _'What is currently playing?'_.

For quick start, please proceed with the [Quick Start](#quick-start) guide. More information
on how to use the [Media Session Connector] can be found on its documentation page and
the Android developer pages describing [Working with a mediaSession] and [Building a video app].

## Guides

This app is an extension of a [THEO Basic Playback] application. For help with getting started with
THEOplayer, Android Studio and Android Media Sessions feel free to check related guides:

* [THEO Knowledge Base - Android Studio Setup]
* [THEO Knowledge Base - Virtual and Physical Devices]
* [THEOplayer How To's - THEOplayer Android SDK Integration]

## Quick Start

1. Optionally obtain a THEOplayer license. By default the THEOplayer SDK only plays assets hosted on 
the `theoplayer.com` domain. For play-out of other streams first obtain a license at the 
[THEOplayer portal](https://portal.theoplayer.com/).

2. Open _**THEO Custom Ads**_ application in Android Studio.

   For more information about installing Android Studio please check
   [THEO Knowledge Base - Android Studio Setup] guide.

   Android Studio should automatically synchronize and rebuild project. If this won't happen please
   select **File > Sync Project with Gradle Files** menu item to do it manually. Please note, that
   in very rare cases it will be required to synchronize project twice.

3. Specify the obtained THEOplayer license in the [AndroidManifest.xml](./app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml),
if applicable.

```xml
    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="THEOPLAYER_LICENSE"
            android:value="@string/theoplayer_license" />
    </application>
```

4. Select **Run > Run 'app'** menu item to run application on a device selected by default.

   To change the device please select **Run > Select Device...** menu item. For more information
   about working with Android devices please check [THEO Knowledge Base - Virtual and Physical Devices]
   guide.
